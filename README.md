This [OpenSeadragon](http://openseadragon.github.io/) plugin provides 
a scale bar which adjusts depending on the zoom level.

A demo is available [here](https://pages.nist.gov/OpenSeadragonScalebar/).

For OpenSeadragon 1.x, use the 1.x releases of this plugin.

For OpenSeadragon 2.x, use the master branch of this plugin.

Note: If you are displaying multiple images in OpenSeadragon 2.x, this plugin
assumes that the provided pixelsPerMeter is the one of the image at index 0
in world.getItemAt. You can change that index via the referenceItemIdx option.

It can be used like this:
`````javascript
var viewer = new OpenSeadragon.Viewer(...);
viewer.scalebar({
  minWidth: ...,
  pixelsPerMeter: ...,
  color: ...,
  ...
});
`````

To change any property, just call viewer.scalebar with the updated property.
For example, to change the pixelsPerMeter:

`````javascript
viewer.scalebar({
  pixelsPerMeter: ...
});
`````

To change the unit system from the default of Metric to Imperial,
you must reference the `sizeAndTextRenderer` function in the library directly:

`````javascript
viewer.scalebar({
  ...
  sizeAndTextRenderer: OpenSeadragon.ScalebarSizeAndTextRenderer.IMPERIAL_LENGTH,
  ...
});
`````

To change the unit system from the default of Metric to Astronomical,
you must reference the `sizeAndTextRenderer` function in the library directly:

`````javascript
viewer.scalebar({
  ...
  sizeAndTextRenderer: OpenSeadragon.ScalebarSizeAndTextRenderer.ASTRONOMY,
  ...
});
`````

The list of all the options can be found and tested on the [demo site](https://pages.nist.gov/OpenSeadragonScalebar/).

If type, pixelsPerMeter or location are not set (or set to 0), the bar is hidden.


The `getAsCanvas` method let one retrieve the scalebar as a canvas element like this:
```javascript
var canvas = viewer.scalebarInstance.getAsCanvas();
```

To retrieve the current display of the OpenSeadragon viewer with the scalebar,
one can use the `getImageWithScalebarAsCanvas` method:
```javascript
var canvas = viewer.scalebarInstance.getImageWithScalebarAsCanvas();
```

Since it is [difficult to define the anchor point](https://github.com/usnistgov/OpenSeadragonScalebar/issues/2) upon rotation. It is recommended to disable `stayInsideImage` if rotation is supported:
`````javascript
viewer.scalebar({
  ...
  stayInsideImage: false,
  ...
});
`````
